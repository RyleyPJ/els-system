delete the els-system folder after downloading as its not needed and wont work in FiveM

# els-system
Resource has not been tested, but if you have trouble please contact me on discord that is in the README inside the folder and tell me what the issue/error is (if there is any) this will more than likley get updated if this gets a decent amount of downloads, if it does ill do a full revamp of this ELS and make it better!
